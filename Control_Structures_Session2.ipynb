        "1. **Variable Initialization**:\n",
        "   - `age = 10`: We start by initializing the variable `age` with a value of `10`. This represents the age of a person for which we want to determine the life stage.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **First Conditional Check - `if` Statement**:\n",
        "   - `if age >= 18:`: This line checks whether the value of `age` is greater than or equal to `18`.\n",
        "   - If this condition is `True`, the code inside this block will execute, and `\"Adult\"` will be printed.\n",
        "   - In our case, since `age` is `10`, this condition is `False`, so we move to the next conditional statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Second Conditional Check - `elif` (else if) Statement**:\n",
        "   - `elif age >= 13:`: This line is a subsequent condition that checks if `age` is greater than or equal to `13`.\n",
        "   - If the condition is `True`, the code inside this block will execute, printing `\"Teenager\"`.\n",
        "   - However, for `age = 10`, this condition is also `False`, so we again move to the next block.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Final Condition - `else` Statement**:\n",
        "   - `else:`: This is the final part of our conditional structure. It does not have a condition; instead, it catches any cases not caught by the preceding `if` and `elif` statements.\n",
        "   - Since the `age` is neither `18` or older nor `13` or older, this `else` block is executed, printing `\"Child\"`.\n",

The structure of `if-elif-else` is a common pattern in Python for branching execution based on the value of variables.

        "Let's break down the code:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Variable Initialization**:\n",
        "   - `age = 1`: We start by setting the variable `age` to `1`. This represents the age of an individual for whom we are determining the life stage category.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Second Conditional Check - First `elif` (else if) Statement**:\n",
        "   - `elif 1 <= age <= 3:`: This line checks if the age is between `1` and `3`, inclusive.\n",
        "   - If the condition is `True`, the code inside this block will execute, printing `\"Baby\"`.\n",
        "   - For `age = 1`, this condition is `True`. Therefore, `\"Baby\"` is printed, and the program does not check the subsequent `elif` or `else` blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Third Conditional Check - Second `elif` Statement** (Note: This block is not reached in this specific example):\n",
        "   - `elif age >= 13:`: This line checks whether the age is greater than or equal to `13`.\n",
        "   - If the condition is `True`, the code inside this block will execute, printing `\"Teenager\"`.\n",
        "   - However, as we've seen, the program has already found a `True` condition in the previous `elif` block and printed `\"Baby\"`, so this block would not be executed for `age = 1`.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Final Condition - `else` Statement** (Note: This block is not reached in this specific example):\n",
        "   - `else:`: This is the final part of our conditional structure. It captures any cases not addressed by the preceding `if` and `elif` statements.\n",
        "   - If none of the above conditions were `True`, this block would execute, printing `\"Child\"`.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the code correctly categorizes a person with an age of `1` as a `\"Baby\"`. This example demonstrates how the `if-elif-else` structure allows for detailed and sequential checking of conditions, ensuring that each possible range of age is considered, and the appropriate category is printed.\n"

        "#### Explanation of Summing Numbers with a while Loop\n",
        "\n",
        "This code snippet demonstrates how to use a `while` loop to calculate the sum of numbers from `1` to `5`. The loop iterates, adding each number to a cumulative total until the specified condition is no longer met.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**:\n",
        "   - `sum = 0`: We start by initializing the variable `sum` to `0`. This variable will accumulate the total sum as numbers are added to it in each iteration.\n",
        "   - `num = 1`: We also initialize the variable `num` to `1`. This variable acts as our counter and represents the current number to be added to `sum`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Starting the while Loop**:\n",
        "   - `while num <= 5:`: This is our loop condition. The loop will continue executing as long as the value of `num` is less than or equal to `5`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Summing the Numbers**:\n",
        "   - Inside the loop, we perform the operation `sum = sum + num`. This adds the current value of `num` to `sum`. For each iteration, `sum` keeps accumulating the total:\n",
        "     - 1st iteration: `sum = 0 + 1 = 1`\n",
        "     - 2nd iteration: `sum = 1 + 2 = 3`\n",
        "     - 3rd iteration: `sum = 3 + 3 = 6`\n",
        "     - 4th iteration: `sum = 6 + 4 = 10`\n",
        "     - 5th iteration: `sum = 10 + 5 = 15`\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Printing Intermediate Results**:\n",
        "   - After each addition, we print the intermediate value of `sum` using `print(\"sum= \", sum)`. This shows how `sum` is changing after each iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Incrementing the Counter**:\n",
        "   - We then increment `num` by `1` using `num = num + 1`. This ensures that the loop progresses and eventually meets the termination condition.\n",
        "   - We also print the updated value of `num` using `print(\"num= \", num)` to observe how `num` changes in each iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Loop Continuation and Termination**:\n",
        "   - The loop continues until `num` exceeds `5`. At this point, the condition `num <= 5` becomes `False`, and the loop terminates.\n",
        "   - By the end of the loop, `sum` holds the total sum of numbers from `1` to `5`, which is `15`.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, this code snippet effectively demonstrates the use of a `while` loop to accumulate a sum. It illustrates the concept of maintaining and updating variables within a loop, as well as the importance of having a clear termination condition to prevent infinite loops.\n"

        "   - `for i in range(1, 10)`: The loop starts with `i` at `1` and will continue up to, but not including, `10`. The range generates numbers `1, 2, 3, ..., 9`.\n",
